## Current milestone: EXEC-001

EXEC-001 establishes the deterministic Groww broker-adapter boundary after PLAN-001 and RISK-002. The adapter remains isolated from AI, strategy, and risk calculations and keeps provider submission disabled by default.

### Files added

- `brain/41_EXEC_GROWW_BROKER_ADAPTER_SPECIFICATION.md`

### Safety

The execution boundary requires an approved PLAN-001 trade intent and RISK-002 decision. Development and paper environments do not submit orders. Production execution remains locked until EXEC-002 verifies the required runtime/static-IP controls. No credentials or access tokens are stored in the repository.

All project development is performed directly on `main`. No pull request or separate development branch is required.

## Completion Rule

A feature is complete only after implementation, deterministic tests, documentation, and operational checks. CI is the final verification gate and should receive only one coherent, preflight-reviewed commit for each milestone.

## User Action Required

No Groww secret, access token, broker credential, or model API key is required for EXEC-001 boundary development. Do not commit credentials.
