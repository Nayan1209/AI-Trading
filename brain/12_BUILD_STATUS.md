## Current milestone: AI-004

AI-004 introduces a deterministic prompt-construction boundary between AI-003 orchestration and any future model adapter. It accepts only validated `AIAnalysisContext`, keeps system instructions separate from caller-supplied data, serializes mappings with stable key ordering, preserves `Decimal` values as exact strings, and carries an explicit prompt version.

### Files added

- `brain/34_AI_PROMPT_CONSTRUCTION_SPECIFICATION.md`
- `src/ai_prompt.py`
- `tests/test_ai_prompt.py`

### Safety

No live model call, network request, broker access, order execution, credential handling, risk override, or market-data retrieval is introduced. External context remains untrusted data.

## Immediate Next Step

Run the automatic GitHub Actions CI for the complete AI-004 change set. If green, mark AI-004 complete and define the next AI-analysis boundary before implementing further functionality.

## User Action Required

No Groww secret, access token, broker credential, or model API key is required for AI-004. Do not commit credentials.

All project development is performed directly on `main`. No pull request or separate development branch is required.

## Completion Rule

A feature is complete only after implementation, deterministic tests, documentation, and operational checks. CI is the final verification gate and should receive only one coherent, preflight-reviewed commit for each milestone.
