## Current milestone: AI-006

AI-006 introduces a deterministic response-parsing boundary after the AI-005 model adapter. The parser accepts only an `AIModelResponse`, parses its untrusted content as strict JSON, rejects unsupported or missing fields, preserves numeric values as `Decimal`, injects trusted model/prompt metadata from AI-005, and validates the final structure through the AI-001 `AIAnalysis` contract.

### Files added

- `brain/36_AI_RESPONSE_PARSING_SPECIFICATION.md`
- `src/ai_response.py`
- `tests/test_ai_response.py`

### Safety

AI-006 does not decide whether a trade is safe or executable. It does not access brokers, execute orders, fetch market data, call external services, or override deterministic risk controls. Model output remains untrusted until it passes the parser and AI-001 validation boundary.

## Immediate Next Step

Run the automatic GitHub Actions CI for the complete AI-006 change set. If green, mark AI-006 complete and define the next AI-analysis boundary before implementing further functionality.

## User Action Required

No Groww secret, access token, broker credential, or model API key is required for AI-006. Do not commit credentials.

All project development is performed directly on `main`. No pull request or separate development branch is required.

## Completion Rule

A feature is complete only after implementation, deterministic tests, documentation, and operational checks. CI is the final verification gate and should receive only one coherent, preflight-reviewed commit for each milestone.
