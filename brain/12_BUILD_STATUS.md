## Current milestone: PLAN-001

PLAN-001 introduces the deterministic trade-planning boundary after AI-007 and RISK-001. It preserves the validated trade prices and consumes only the bounded quantity and risk values produced by RISK-001.

### Files added

- `brain/39_TRADE_PLANNER_SPECIFICATION.md`
- `src/trade_planner.py`
- `tests/test_trade_planner.py`

### Safety

PLAN-001 creates an immutable broker-independent order intent only. It does not authorize live execution, call a broker, access credentials, call a model provider, or bypass RISK-001.

## Immediate Next Step

Run the automatic GitHub Actions CI for the complete PLAN-001 change set. If green, mark PLAN-001 complete and proceed to the next Phase 5 boundary.

## User Action Required

No Groww secret, access token, broker credential, or model API key is required for PLAN-001. Do not commit credentials.

All project development is performed directly on `main`. No pull request or separate development branch is required.

## Completion Rule

A feature is complete only after implementation, deterministic tests, documentation, and operational checks. CI is the final verification gate and should receive only one coherent, preflight-reviewed commit for each milestone.
