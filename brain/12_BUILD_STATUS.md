## Completed in this milestone
- Groww Trading API selected as the initial India-first broker/market-data provider.
- Groww API key approval confirmed by project owner; no credential value stored in GitHub.
- Groww adapter responsibilities and internal contracts documented.
- Groww Python SDK added as a project dependency.
- Read-only `GrowwMarketDataProvider` skeleton added.
- Groww quote normalization test added using a local fake client; the test does not call Groww.
- GitHub Actions CI added to run the Python test suite on pushes and pull requests.
- `.env.example` updated with a placeholder for the runtime Groww access token.
- Groww rate limits, live-feed subscription boundary and token lifecycle documented from current official provider documentation.
- Static-IP requirement recorded as a production execution prerequisite.
- Safety boundary preserved: no live order has been enabled or placed by this project.
- Instrument master model and lookup registry implemented without requiring live Groww credentials.
- Groww instrument CSV normalization and India-first CASH filtering implemented.
- Instrument lookup paths implemented for internal ID, Groww symbol, exchange/trading symbol and exchange token.
- Instrument validation tests added for mapping, filtering, duplicate detection and required fields.
- Instrument-master specification added under `brain/13_INSTRUMENT_MASTER_SPECIFICATION.md`.
- Groww CASH and FNO instrument fixture rows corrected and CI validated.
- Instrument model permits provider-supplied zero values for `lot_size` and `freeze_quantity`.
- DATA-004 validation/staleness specification added under `brain/14_DATA_VALIDATION_STALENESS_SPECIFICATION.md`.
- Deterministic candle validation added for identity, timezone, positive OHLC, OHLC relationships and non-negative volume.
- Deterministic staleness detection added using caller-supplied freshness thresholds.
- DATA-004 unit tests added without live Groww credentials.
- `MarketDataService.latest()` integrated with deterministic validation and fail-closed staleness checks.
- Service-level tests added for fresh and stale provider output using deterministic timestamps.

## Immediate Next Step
**DATA-004 CI gate:** run the GitHub Actions test suite against the complete DATA-004 change set. If CI is green, mark DATA-004 complete and begin DATA-005 historical candle ingestion. If CI fails, fix the failing test/build before adding new functionality.

## User Action Required
No Groww secret or access token is required for DATA-004. Do **not** commit credentials. The validation and service tests are deterministic and do not call Groww.

## Completion Rule
A feature is complete only after implementation, tests, documentation, and operational checks. The README and this tracker must be updated immediately after each milestone.
